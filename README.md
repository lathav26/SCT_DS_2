Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
In todayâ€™s competitive business environment, understanding customer behavior is crucial for effective marketing and decision-making. This project focuses on customer segmentation using the Mall Customers dataset, which contains details like Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

The main objective of this project is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their income levels and spending patterns. By applying K-Means clustering, we can divide customers into different segments, such as high-income high-spending, low-income low-spending, and so on.

This segmentation helps businesses:

Understand customer purchasing behavior.

Personalize marketing campaigns.

Improve customer satisfaction.

Increase sales and retention.  

Cluster 1: High-income, low-spending customers.

Cluster 2: Average-income, average-spending customers.

Cluster 3: High-income, high-spending customers (Premium customers).

Cluster 4: Low-income, low-spending customers.

Cluster 5: Low-income, high-spending customers (value-seeking customers).
